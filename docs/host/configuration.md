# Configuration

The configuration of _HuddleUp_ is achieved through environment variables and configuration files. They are separated between the **client** and the **frontend** application.

## External services

_HuddleUp_ depends on two external services: A provider for the video conference functionality, and an identity provider which is used for user authentication.

### Video conference provider

See section [Conference Providers](conference-providers.md)

### Identity provider

_HuddleUp_ supports any service that supports [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC). A commonly used provider is [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect). If you want more control, you can use a service like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/authentication) which provides a free offer that should be enough for the expected user count of a _HuddleUp_ installation.

## Translations

_HuddleUp_ can support multiple languages. You can configure which language should be the default and which additional languages should be supported. The currently available languages and their language codes are:

- English (`en`)
- Deutsch (`de`)

### Predefined Tags

To give users guidance on topics, you can configure _HuddleUp_ to create a set of predefined tags. These tags can be defined in a `tags.json` file in the `config/api` folder. On startup, _HuddleUp_ will create any tag that is defined in this file. There is an example file located there which you can copy, or you can create a new file. It should follow the following structure:

```json title="config/api/tags.json"
{
  "tags": [
    "Your tag #1",
    "Another tag",
    // ...
  ]
}
```
