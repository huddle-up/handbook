# Conference Providers

The video conference functionality of _HuddleUp_ is implemented through the integration of existing services. Currently only [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org) is available.

## Jitsi Meet

When using Jitsi Meet there are two options: Using the public instance (located at [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si)), or [hosting an instance yourself](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-start). While using the public instance will not cause you any additional costs, it also has certain restrictions.

Features not supported by the public instance:

- ❌ **Moderator rights**: All participants have the same rights. This means a meeting on the public instance can easily be hijacked by participants.
- ❌ **Access protection**: No restrictions on who can enter. Participants that know the meeting link, can join.
- ❌ **Custom extensions**: Jitsi can be extended by different plugins. Obviously you cannot install them on the public instance.

### Self hosted instance integrations

When hosting a Jitsi instance yourself, _HuddleUp_ can provide better access permissions and user permissions when using Jitsi [JWT functionality](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/tokens.md). When installing the [Moderator Token Plugin](https://github.com/nvonahsen/jitsi-token-moderation-plugin/) on your instance, hosts get instant moderator rights through the JWT token generated by _HuddleUp_.

### Configuration

The following Jitsi specific configuration variables can placed in the [backend configuration file](configuration.md#backend-configuration).

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| HU_JITSI_HOST | **Required**. The base URL of the Jitsi Instance (`https://meet.jit.si` for the public instance) | -- |
| **Self hosted only** | | |
| HU_JITSI_JWT_ENABLED | Whether the JWT functionality is enabled on the instance (`true` or `false`) | -- |
| HU_JITSI_JWT_APP_ID | The application id configured in the Jitsi instance | -- |
| HU_JITSI_JWT_SECRET | The secret configured in the Jitsi instance | -- |
