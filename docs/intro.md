# Introduction

_HuddleUp_ is a place to discuss, meet and get to know each other online. You can explore existing meetings and participate if you are interested, or you can host your own.

_HuddleUp_ is the result of a bachelor's thesis in computer science at the [OST - Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch). The goal of the application is to be as open as possible and allow the operator to configure it to their liking. The feature set is currently limited, but could be extended in the future.

As the application is early in its development, a lot of its features and implementation can change in future releases.
