# Host a Meeting

Besides participating in meetings, you can also create your own meetings. All your meetings are listed in the **My meetings** view. A meeting has a title, description, tags for categorization, start date, scheduled end date and the maximum number of allowed participants.

## Create a Meeting

To create a new meeting, click "Create Meeting" in the navigation at the top of the page. Provide information about your meeting, save it and you're already done. Make sure to provide enough information for participants to find the meeting and understand what it's about.

## Running the Meeting

You can start the meeting shortly before its planned start date. The process of running a meeting is separated into four steps: _Start_, _Share_, _Meet_, _Finished_.

### Start

To start the conference, navigate to your meetings detail page and click on "Start Conference".

### Share

In this step, the video conference is created and ready for you to join. It is _not_ available to participants, yet. This is meant to give you the time to join the conference and set it up before the participants join.

Once you're ready and the start date of the conference has been reached, you can share it with participants by clicking "Make Public". This will mark the conference as running to all users and allow participants to join it.

### Meet

The video conference is running and participants can join. The meeting will be marked as **Live** until its planned _end date_. Once this date is reached, the conference will _not_ be closed, but participants will not be able to join it anymore. Once you've finished your meeting, you can end it by pressing "End Video Conference".

:::important

Make sure to end the conference in _HuddleUp_ once you're finished. Depending on the video conference platform used (e.g. Jitsi Meet) the conference will not be closed automatically. This means that the conference will be shown as running to you until you end it manually.

### Finished

Once the conference is ended, the meeting is completed.

## Update a Meeting

All properties of a meeting can be update until it has been started, or reached its start date. You **cannot make any changes** after that point. To update a meeting, navigate to a meetings detail page and click "Edit Meeting" at the bottom of the page.

## Cancel a Meeting

If you cannot hold a meeting, or decided not to do it, you can cancel it. You can cancel a meeting up until its planned start date. Once a meeting is canceled, it will be marked as such and no participations will be allowed. You **cannot uncancel a canceled meeting**, so make sure you really want to cancel it.

To cancel a meeting, edit it and click "Cancel Meeting" at the bottom of the update page.
