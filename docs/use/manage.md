# Host a Meeting

Besides participating in meetings, you can also create your own meetings. All your meetings are listed in the **My meetings** view. A meeting has a title, description, tags for categorization, start date, scheduled end date and the maximum number of allowed participants.

#### Start video conference

Just before the start date, the organizer can start the process for conducting the video conference.

#### Share video conference

In the next step, the organizer can enable access for the participants. Only from this point on the video conference is visible to all as ongoing. An ongoing meeting is highlighted in red for all users and marked as **Live**. The registered participants can now join the video conference.

#### Video conference active

The video conference is active as long as there are participants in the video conference. Since we cannot read out the active participants for every video conference provider, the organizer must perform the termination of the meeting in _HuddleUp_ separately.

The access via _HuddleUp_ is automatically prevented after the scheduled end date. A new access via _HUddleUp_ is not possible afterwards, even if the video conference is still active.

#### Video conference finished

The meeting will be marked as closed and participation is no longer possible.
